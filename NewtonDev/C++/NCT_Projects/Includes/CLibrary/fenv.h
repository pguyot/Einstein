It is modeled after the *	Numerical C Extensions Group’s requirements ( NCEG / X3J11.1 ).	*													 **	The file <fenv.h> declares many functions in support of numerical*	programming.  It provides a set of environmental controls similar to*	the ones found in <SANE.h>.  Programs that test flags or run under*	non-default modes must do so under the effect of an enabling	*	"fenv_access" pragma.								*												*	Note that the rounding mode maskes are dummies, because ARM has round  *	bits in each instruction.							*												*	Copyright © 1993,95 Apple Computer, Inc.
