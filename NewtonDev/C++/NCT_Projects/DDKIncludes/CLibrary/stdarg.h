So, for				example, if your list is a list of pointers, you can not				say va_hack(MyStruct*).  You must define MyStructPtr and				then you may successfully utter va_hack(MyStructPtr).	Example:	Boolean RSect(Rect *minRect, short count, Rect *r1, ...)	{		typedef Rect* RectPtr;		RectPtr		curRectPtr;		va_list		args;		va_start(args, r1);		if (condition to quit early) {			va_end(args);			return(false);		}		for (count--; count > 0; count--) {			va_hack(RectPtr);			curRectPtr = va_arg(args, RectPtr);		}		va_end(args);		return(true);	} */#pragma force_top_level#pragma include_only_once/* stdarg.h: ANSI 'C' (X3J11 Oct 88) library header, section 4.8 *//* Copyright (C) Codemist Ltd. *//* version 3 */#ifndef __stdarg_h#define __stdarg_h#ifdef __cplusplus#define ___type#define ___assert(x,y) 0#endif/* * stdarg.h declares a type and defines three macros, for advancing through a * list of arguments whose number and types are not known to the called * function when it is translated.

The rightmost parameter plays a special role in the access * mechanism, and will be called parmN in this description. *//* N.B. <stdio.h> is required to declare vfprintf() without defining      *//* va_list.
