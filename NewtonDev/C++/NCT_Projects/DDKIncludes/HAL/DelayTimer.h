/*	File:		DelayTimer.h	Contains:	DelayTimer implements a fast timer polling service based on the timer0				free-running timer. Also includes a useful global routine for				one-shot delays...	Copyright:	© 1992-1997 by Apple Computer, Inc., all rights reserved.		Derived from v2 (11/18/94) internal	Notes:				UNLESS YOU ARE IN THE ROM, use ConvertToHardwareTime() to generate values				to pass to the delay routines. This will ensure that you continue to				work on future platforms (like Voyager-based Newton's) where the hardware				time base is different.				Use only for short delays (remember, no polling!).				Polled timer handling routines. 2 varieties of timer routines are provided:				1. Busy wait a specified time: call ShortTimerDelay.				2. Busy wait while looking for some event (e.g., waiting for some SCC register bit to				   change. Call ResetTimeOut at the start, then call TimedOut as needed to see if the				   time has expired. Right now this kind of call can't be nested: it would be easy to				   support nested calls: the caller would simply be responsible for remembering the start				   time and delay, and passing these to the routine (could be an object).				The timeout routines are typically called with interrupts disabled! Timing will be less					exact, otherwise...*/#ifndef __DELAYTIMER_H#define	__DELAYTIMER_Htypedef signed long	FastBoolean;extern void ShortTimerDelay(THardwareTimeUnits delay);	// pass delay in HardwareTimeUnitsclass TDelayTimer : private SingleObject {public:						TDelayTimer();	// 	Conversion routines between TTimeout's and THardwareTimeUnits's.
