Apple DocViewer UserÕs GuideQuick SummaryYou are now using Apple DocViewer, an application that lets you display, read, and search documentation on your screen. DocViewer also lets you copy the text and graphics it displays for use with other applications. You can print all or part of any DocViewer document.DocViewer reads only document files marked by a   or  icon. These files have been created for DocViewer from original text documents or from other DocViewer documents.To go through this userÕs guide page by page, click the up or down arrows at the bottom left of the document window (the window displaying this text). If your screen does not show a full page, use the scroll bars to move around within each page.To quit DocViewer, press Command-Q or choose Quit from the File menu.DocViewer FeaturesWhen DocViewer is active you can see its menus in the menu bar. HereÕs a brief summary of what these menus help you do:¥	The File menu lets you open and close viewer documents, print them, copy them to external text files, and set your preferred scrolling speed. It also lets you create and name collectionsÑassemblies of parts from different documents that act as custom books. Collections are described on page 13.¥	The Edit menu helps you copy text or graphics from a viewer document to the Clipboard. From the Clipboard you can paste the copied material into the documents of other applications.¥	The Navigation menu helps you move from page to page within the document you are currently viewing (the active document). Additional navigation controls (for example, the page arrows and scroll bars) are located at the edges of DocViewerÕs document window.¥	The Search menu helps you find specific words or phrases in the text of one or more viewer documents.¥	The Bookmark menu lets you mark places in a document with your own labels. ¥	The Outlines menu lets you see the table of contents (TOC) or book index that DocViewer creates for the currently active document. It lets you collapse and expand the levels of detail in either of these lists. You can easily go to specific places in the active document by double-clicking lines in the TOC or the book index.¥	The Windows menu lets you move from one document to another when you have multiple documents open in DocViewer.The rest of this guide explains these features in more detail.At the end of this guide is a section that lists all the DocViewer menu commands and their keyboard equivalents. If you use DocViewer often, you may want to print this section and post it near your monitor.The DocViewer EnvironmentDocViewer runs on all models of Macintosh computers from the Macintosh Plus onward. It runs in versions 6.0.5 and later of the Macintosh system software, including version 7.1. For full functionality, DocViewer requires a RAM partition of at least 1024 KB.For best results, run DocViewer from a local hard disk or local CD-ROM drive, not from a file server. The DocViewer application file takes about 400 KB of disk space.Your system may need specific fonts to display or print certain viewer documents correctly. Required fonts are normally specified in a Read Me file that accompanies viewer documents or sets of documents; they may also be supplied in a Fonts folder if the documents are on a CD-ROM disk. If youÕre not using System 7, you should install the TrueType system extension. For best viewing results, your system should contain both bitmap and TrueType versions of the fonts used by the documents being read.Viewing and PrintingDocViewer reads only viewer documents or collectionsÑfiles that have been constructed specifically to be read by DocViewer.You can open a viewer document in several ways:¥	If DocViewer is not open or is not the active application, you can open the document from the Finder.¥	If DocViewer is the active application, choose Open from the File menu and use the standard file dialog box to find the document you wish to open.¥	If part of a document has been copied into a collection, you can open the document by double-clicking the copied part in the collectionÕs TOC. Collections are discussed on page 13.DocViewer files are usually accompanied by index files, the names of which end in .idx. You canÕt open an index file.Documents open in DocViewer are read-only files, so several users can access the same document at the same time from a file server.To close a viewer document, click the close box or choose Close from the File menu.Sometimes graphics in a viewer document are scaled to fit the page. To see a graphic in its original size, double-click it.Color used in the original version of a viewer document appears on your screen if you have a color monitor.Controlling the Document ViewFigure 1 identifies elements of the DocViewer document window.Figure 1	DocViewer document window¥	The Bookmarks pop-up menu gives you a list of existing bookmarks. To go to a marked place, choose an item in the menu. Bookmarks are discussed on page 15.¥	The text tool lets you select text by dragging, double-clicking, or Shift-clicking. ¥	The rectangle tool lets you select an area of text or graphics or both by dragging a rectangle over it.¥	The lasso tool lets you select an irregular area of text or graphics or both by drawing a closed line around it.¥	The single-page display icon presents the active document one page at a time.¥	The double-page display icon presents two facing pages. Paging commands shift two pages at a time.¥	The continuous display icon presents pages end to end. You can use the vertical scroll bar to go through an entire document.¥	The text-only display icon presents pages of plain text without formatting or typographic styles. To change the typography of the display, choose Format from the Edit menu. To see a drawing, click the Open button that appears to the left of the figure caption.¥	The Size pop-up menu lets you enlarge or reduce the document in a range from 25% to 400%.¥	The page indicator tells you what page in the document youÕre viewing. If you click the page indicator, it opens the Go To Page dialog box (described on page 21).¥	The page arrows let you move backward and forward one page at a time.¥	The scroll bars let you move around inside a page. If you have selected the continuous or the text-only display, the vertical scroll bar lets you move through the entire document. Setting the Scrolling SpeedThe Preferences dialog box, accessible by choosing Preferences from the File menu, lets you set the speed at which the scroll arrows move all documentsÑfrom 1 pixel per click (slow) to 100 pixels per click (fast).Scrolling speed is recorded in a file named Apple DocViewer.Pref, which is kept in the Preferences folder inside the System Folder. If DocViewer is used with System 6 and no Preferences folder exists in the System Folder, DocViewer creates one. Selecting Text and GraphicsYou must select text in a viewer document before copying it, designating it as a place for a new bookmark, or searching for the same text elsewhere in the document. To select text, click the text tool and follow the standard Macintosh text selection rules:¥	To select a single word, double-click it.¥	To select a run of text, drag over it or Shift-click it.You must select a graphic before copying it. Click the rectangle or lasso tool and draw a line around the graphic. You can select all or any part of a graphic in the document window. You cannot select within a separate graphic window.Copying From a Viewer DocumentThe Copy command in the Edit menu lets you copy any selected text or graphic in the active viewer document.To see the material you have copied, choose Show Clipboard from the Edit menu.Text is copied as a plain character streamÑwith tab characters but without tabbing instructions, graphics, typographic styling, hidden text, or elements supplied by templates. Graphic material is copied in PICT format. If you include text in a graphic selection (such as the caption with a figure), it is copied graphically, not as text.You can move to a document in another application (such as a word processor or a development system) and use the Paste command to place the contents of the Clipboard at the insertion point. In this way you can copy viewer material into any application that pastes from the Clipboard. For example, copying and pasting from DocViewer lets you transfer code samples from Inside Macintosh into your development system. You cannot change a viewer document or import anything into it.Printing a Viewer DocumentYou can print any page range in a viewer document by using the Print commands in the File menu. Printing will always follow the documentÕs original format and typography, regardless of the current display mode.The Page Setup command displays the standard Page Setup dialog box. The correct page setup settings for a viewer document are usually specified in its Read Me file.The Print One command prints only the visible portion of the active document, which may be more than one page if you are in double-page or continuous display mode. It can also print the contents of any selected window.The Print command lets you choose a page range and other print characteristics, as shown in Figure 2.Figure 2	Print dialog boxNavigationDocViewer provides several ways to navigate within and among documents:¥	The active TOC window displays the table of contents that DocViewer creates for the active document. You can go to a chapter, section, figure, table, or code listing in a document by double-clicking a line in its TOC. You can have several TOC windows open at one time, giving you quick access to different documents. You can filter the lines in a TOC so that they appear only if they contain a specified keyword.¥	The book index displays the index that DocViewer creates for the active document. Double-clicking an index entry takes you to that reference in the document. You can filter entries in the book index so that they appear only if they contain a specified keyword.¥	The Bookmarks pop-up menu (in the upper-left corner of the document window) displays labels you have given to specific places in the document. You can go to the labeled text by choosing its name in the menu.¥	The Search menu lets you search the text of the active document for specific words or phrases. It also lets you query one or more documents for complex word combinations and constructs a list of all the places where they occur.¥	The Navigation menu provides several ways to find specific pages or sections in the active document.¥	The Query dialog box displays all the instances of a word or phrase in a document or group of documents. Double-clicking a query line takes you to the text where the word or phrase occurs.Using a TOCTo see the table of contents that DocViewer creates for the active document, choose Open Table of Contents from the Outlines menu. This table of contents may differ from the table of contents contained in the documentÕs text.Every line in a TOC contains the name of a section or a numbered element (figure, table, or listing) in a document. A triangle indicator appears to the left of any section that contains subsections. You can use the TOC as follows:¥	Double-clicking a name takes you to that section or element (such as a figure or table). You can also click the name to select it and then press Enter.¥	Clicking a right-pointing triangle expands the subsections within that section.¥	Clicking a downward-pointing triangle collapses the immediate subsections.Special keyboard equivalents for TOC actions are listed on page 24.To expand the entire TOC, choose Expand All from the Outlines menu. To collapse it, choose Collapse All.To change the document levels displayed when a TOC is expanded, choose TOC Level from the Outlines menu.Creating a CollectionA collection is an assembly of documents and parts of documents that you put together under a new title. You can create a collection from any mixture of chapters, sections, and whole documentsÑany text elements that you could access by clicking a line in a table of contents. The result is a custom reference book containing only material you have chosen.To make a new collection, choose New Collection from the File menu. Drag individual lines from different tables of contents into the new empty window. DocViewer copies the TOC lines without disturbing the original documents. If you drag a line that has subsections, DocViewer copies all the subsection references too. Finally, save the collection with a name, using Save As from the File menu.To read any text included in a collection, double-click the line that references it. DocViewer will open the original document and display the text.Here are some rules about collections:¥		You can filter and search a collection in the same way as a table of contents.¥	You can copy lines from one collection to another by dragging them.¥	You can remove a TOC line in a collection by selecting it and pressing the Delete key or choosing Clear from the Edit menu.¥	If you double-click a TOC line in a collection that references text in a document that is not available, DocViewer asks you to locate the document.Using the Book IndexTo see the index that DocViewer creates for the active document, choose Open Book Index from the Outlines menu. This index may differ from the index contained in the documentÕs text. You cannot open a DocViewer index unless the document to which it applies is showing in the active window. The documentÕs index file must also be present in the same folder as the document.  An index file is created at the same time as each viewer document and is identified by the suffix .idx. It is an online versions of the documentÕs printed index.The index opens in collapsed form, showing only index letters. To expand or collapse the index, do the following:¥	To see the subentries for one letter or entry, click the right-pointing triangle beside that letter. ¥	To collapse index entries at any point, click a downward-pointing triangle.¥	To expand the whole index, choose Expand All from the Outlines menu. To collapse it, choose Collapse All.To use the index, double-click an entry. This takes you to the first place in the document referenced by that entry.After you have gone to the first place in the document referenced by an index entry, you can go to subsequent places for the same entry by choosing Next Reference from the Outlines menu. To go backward to previous places, hold down the Shift key while you choose Next Reference.Filtering the Book Index or a TOCAt the bottom of a book index, TOC, or collection window is a box preceded by the word ÒFilter.Ó To see only those entries that contain a certain word or phrase (a keyword), type the keyword in the Filter box and click the Apply button in the lower-right corner of the window. Lines in the index, TOC, or collection that donÕt contain that keyword disappear. To restore the full list, delete the contents of the Filter box and click Apply again.The filter recognizes word components, not just whole words. For example, if you use ÒeventÓ as a keyword the filter accepts words such as Òprevent.ÓCreating and Using BookmarksYou can attach your own labels to places in the active document by using commands in the Bookmark menu in the menu bar, as follows:	1.	Select a piece of text in the active document. To place a bookmark on a figure, select its text caption.	2.	Choose Set from the Bookmark menu. Up to 63 characters of the selected text appear as the default label in the Set Bookmark dialog box. If you want a different label (up to 63 characters long), type it in the dialog boxÕs text field.	3.	Click the Set button.After you have created a bookmark, it appears in the menu that pops up when you click Bookmarks in the upper-left corner of the document window. Choosing a line in the Bookmarks pop-up menu takes you to the page you marked in the document and highlights the text you labeled.To delete a bookmark, choose Delete from the Bookmark menu in the menu bar. In the dialog box that appears, click the name of the bookmark you want to delete and click the Delete button.To rename a bookmark, choose it from the Bookmarks pop-up menu in the document window, then choose Rename from the Bookmark menu in the menu bar. Type the new name in the text field of the dialog box that appears, and click RenameTo list all bookmarks alphabetically (including new ones), choose Alphabetical from the Bookmark menu in the menu bar.To turn off alphabetizing, choose Alphabetical a second time. Bookmarks are then listed in the order of the pages in the document to which they point.Finding TextWhen you choose Find from the Search menu, a dialog box appears. You can enter a string of text characters and ask DocViewer to find the first occurrence of that string beyond the current selection or insertion point in the text. The Find dialog box has several options:¥	Literal finds the string wherever it occursÑfor example, finding ÒeventÓ within Òprevented.Ó ¥	Entire Word finds the string only if the string occurs as a word by itself. Words are defined as continuous strings of letters, numbers, and underscore characters.¥	Search Backwards finds the first occurrence before the current insertion point.¥	Wrap-Around Search searches from the insertion point to one end of the file, and then continues the search at the other end of the file, ensuring that your entire file is searched.¥	Case Sensitive restricts the search to strings with identical capitalization. For example, a search for ÒeventÓ does not find ÒEvent.ÓTo find the first occurrence of a string after the current insertion point, click the Find button. DocViewer takes you to the appropriate page and highlights the string.When you choose Find Again from the Search menu, DocViewer finds the next occurrence of the string after the one just found.When you choose Find Selection from the Search menu, DocViewer searches for the next occurrence of the currently selected text as if you had entered that text in the Find dialog box.If you hold down the Shift key while choosing Find Again or Find Selection, DocViewer searches backward for the previous occurrence.To stop a lengthy Find operation, press Command-period.When you choose Find Again or Find Selection, the Find options (Literal, Entire Word, Backwards, Wrap-Around Search, Case Sensitive Search) remain as previously set.Using the Query CommandWhen you choose Query from the Search menu, DocViewer prepares a list of all occurrences of a specified text structure within a document or set of documents. Such a list is sometimes called a permuted index. The Query dialog box is shown in Figure 3.Figure 3	Query dialog boxThe Query command lets you locate subjects or related ideas for which you canÕt easily define a Find operation. It follows these rules:¥	Query works only if there is an index file for each document being searched and that file is in the same folder as the document file. Index files are discussed on page 14.¥	Strings you are searching for must contain at least one significant word, such as a technical term; you cannot search for a string such as Òwhatever,Ó Òwith which,Ó or Òas in the.Ó¥	The Query search distinguishes only significant words in the text being searched. For example, a Query search for Òtext or graphicsÓ finds Òtext and graphicsÓ as well, because ÒorÓ and ÒandÓ are not significant words.¥	You can search only for entire words or combinations of entire words.¥	All Query searches ignore the differences between uppercase and lowercase characters.¥	In most cases, a search for the singular form of a word also finds the plural form, but a search for the plural form does not find the singular.Numbers in the left margin of the list shown in Figure 3 tell you how many times DocViewer has found the text in each section or document.Figure 3 illustrates the dialog box showing all the Query options. Clicking Fewer Options hides the more complex choices.HereÕs how to use the Query dialog box with its basic options:	1.	Enter the string you want to find in the Search for text box. 	2.	Using the Search pop-up menu, you can choose to search all open documents, all open collections, both documents and collections, or a specific open document.	3.	If you click the Show Context checkbox, DocViewer lists each occurrence and the wording surrounding it. When the Show Context checkbox is not selected, DocViewer lists only the sections where the string was found and the number of occurrences in that section.	4.	Click the Search button. After DocViewer has finished the search, you can choose Expand All from the Outlines menu to view the complete list.	5.	To go to a reference in the original document, double-click that line in the list.	6.	To go to the next reference in the list, choose Next Occurrence from the Search menu.The More Options feature in the Query dialog box gives you two major ways to narrow your search:¥	The ÒIn/not in the same paragraph/section asÓ line lets you narrow the search to a specific combination of strings in the same part of a document. Enter the second string in the text box and tailor the search by using the pop-up menus.¥	The ÒWithin/not within <nn> words ofÓ line narrows the search to combinations in which another string occurs or does not occur near the first string you are searching for. The number you enter for the word distance may run from 1 to 9000.To delete your choices from the Query dialog box, click the Clear button.Closing a document removes its entries from any list previously generated by the Query dialog box.Using the Navigation MenuThe Navigation menu gives you several ways to go from page to page in the active document:¥	The First Page, Last Page, Previous Page, and Next Page commands take you to those pages of the active document. If you are viewing the document in double-page display mode, Previous Page and Next Page make two-page moves. If you have an extended keyboard, you can also use its Home and End keys to take you to the first and last pages of the active document.¥	The Previous Heading and Next Heading commands take you to the previous or next subhead at any level.¥	The Go To command displays a dialog box that lets you enter a page number to go to. The number you enter must be the serial page number that appears in parentheses in the lower-left corner of the document window.¥	The Display Selection command takes you to the page where text is currently selected or where the text insertion point is currently located.¥	The Go Forward and Go Backward commands refer to a navigation record that DocViewer maintains. As you move from page to page, it records the last 15 pages you have viewed. The go commands take you back and forth along this personal route. For example, if you have most recently viewed pages 5, then 12, then 8, choosing Go Backward once takes you from page 8 back to page 12; choosing it a second time takes you from page 12 back to page 5. Two Go Forward commands then return you from page 5 to page 8.You can also move from page to page in the active document by using the page-up and page-down arrows in the bottom margin of the document window.Keyboard EquivalentsMany of DocViewerÕs commands have keyboard equivalents.
