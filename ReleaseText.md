Releases use different User Interface libraries:
 - Cocoa is Paul's original version running on MacOS without additional software
 - FLTK adds PCMCIA and Toolkit support and runs on all desktop platforms
 - the Androis version uses NDK directly and is not yet part of this release yet
 - due to restriction in the Apple Stroe, the iOS version needs to be built from source as explained in BUILDING.md 

And as always, enjoy, and give us feedback, no matter if good or bad.
