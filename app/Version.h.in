// ============================================================================ //
// The numbering system originated as a response to customer irrationality. :-)
// Because each patch applies to a single ROM image, there are multiple patches
// that produce the same end result. The exact numbers may be off, but let's say
// the OMP had version 1.0 software, then the MP100 came out with version 1.1.
// We released an update for the OMP that brought it up to date, and gave
// it version 1.01.
//
// The problem here is that even though 1.01 and 1.1 are functionally
// equivalent, people with OMPs were unhappy because their version number was
// lower. There was lots of misinformation floating around about "upgrading"
// 1.01 to 1.1, meaningless though that actually was. It got even worse when
// 1.1 was patched, so you had 1.03 vs. 1.12.
//
// To address this, we had to distinguish between the actual version number that
// tells tech support what software the customer has and the end-user version
// number that tells the customer what functionality they have. The six-digit
// number is unique to a particular update (software version), and the x.y
// number indicates what functionality you get when the update is
// applied (end-user version).
//
// Unfortunately, some customers are a little too smart to fall for that, so
// there's still all sorts of consternation over the supposedly meaningless
// system update numbers.
//
// The actual scheme is some combination of the ROM version the update applies
// to and the date the patch was generated.
