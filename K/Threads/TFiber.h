/**
 Class for a fiber.

 A Fiber is a light-weight thread that allows a task to use different stacks and
 environments quickly, but prohibts running consecutively, avoiding collisions
 and race conditions.

 A Fiber is created at a non-timecritical initialisation phase, putting the
 fiber in "stopped" state.

 When stopped, the main program can launch a new Fiber using Run(). The main
 thread is suspended and the fiber is set to "running".

 When runnign, the Fiber may suspend itself. This will cause Run() to return
 a non-zero value. The main thread will resume in the main context. The Fiber
 is in "suspended" mode and can only continue via Resume().

 When running, the Fiber call will eventually return, putting the Fiber back
 into "stopped" mode. Run() will return 0 and the main thread will resume in
 the main context.

// ============================================================================= //
//         There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the      //
// warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked the programmer: "Which is easier to design: //
// an accounting package or an operating system?"                                //
//         "An operating system," replied the programmer.                        //
//         The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  "Surely an          //
// accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating          //
// system," he said.                                                             //
//         "Not so," said the programmer, "when designing an accounting package, //
// the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:  //
// how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to  //
// the tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited by outside     //
// appearances.  When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the    //
// simplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating system  //
// is easier to design."                                                         //
//         The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  "That is all good and well, but //
// which is easier to debug?"                                                    //
//         The programmer made no reply.                                         //
//                 -- Geoffrey James, "The Tao of Programming"                   //
