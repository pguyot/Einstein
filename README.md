Einstein officially runs on macOS, iOS, and Ubuntu Linux with partial support for Android,
Raspberry Pi, and Windows.

A Newton ROM file is required to run Einstein.  We cannot distribute the ROM file.  If you
own a Newton device, you may be able to dump your own ROM file from it.
See [Dumping The Rom](../../wiki/Dumping-The-Rom) for more information.

Once you have Einstein up and running, refer to the
[user manual](https://github.com/pguyot/Einstein/blob/master/Documentation/UserManual.pdf).
